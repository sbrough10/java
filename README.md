Tests the intersection of two Bezier curves.

The HTML file provided allows one to graphically manipulate the shape of two Bezier curves. Pressing the "Generate" button prints two lines of code to the console which can be pasted into the Java program's `main()` method to represent the graphically manipulated curves with `Curve` objects.

Upon replacing the existing declarations for `curveA` and `curveB` in the `main()` method and running the Java program, a series JavaScript code snippets calling the function `drawPoint()` will be output to the console. These snippets can be copied into the JavaScript console and run to show the intersection points of the two original curves.
